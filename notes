Important

Note that the directory names must all be lowercase and must be consistent with the namespace and the name of the Device Handler or SmartApp. In other words, the directory names must all be lowercase with non-alphanumeric characters replaced with a dash. For example, if a SmartApp has the namespace “My Apps” and the name “My First App” then the path name for it must be smartapps/my-apps/my-first-app.src/my-first-app.groovy.
